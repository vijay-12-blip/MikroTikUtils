## Scripts Overview

### 1. Firewall Script

This script sets up basic firewall rules to protect your network. It blocks unwanted traffic and allows necessary connections.

```bash
# Example of a basic firewall rule
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=22 action=accept comment="Allow SSH"
add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=80 action=accept comment="Allow HTTP"
add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop all other traffic"
```

### 2. Get IP Script

This script retrieves your public IP address and can send it to your Telegram bot.

```bash
# Get public IP
:local ip [/ip address get [find interface="WAN"] address]
:log info "Public IP is $ip"
```

### 3. Telegram Notification Script

This script sends notifications to your Telegram bot when specific events occur.

```bash
# Send message to Telegram
:local token "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
:local chat_id "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
:local message "System Status Alert!"
/tool fetch url="https://api.telegram.org/bot$token/sendMessage?chat_id=$chat_id&text=$message"
